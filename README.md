# Chatify

<div style="text-align: justify">

This is my project to learn to create a chat app using Firebase as a backend.
The design that I am using is from the Figma community, [here it is](https://www.figma.com/file/r2HmOFGs3NiDkGeOFTae1f/Chatify(Chat-Application)-(Community)?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=wDijjPkCUoz6XfKh-0)

With this project, I was learning clean architecture, following a tutorial from resocoder. The first approach was to make few directories representing each features within the app. But immediately, I am facing a problem, I want to use a same entity across the features. So I going to Google the same issue and found a particular solution, the solution is that I am making root directories for data, domain and presentation each. Within each that general directories I am making shared and features directories. So I can store the entity code that would be shared accros the features within shared directory, and implementing the rest architecture within each features directories.

My objective with this project is I want to learn CI/CD by implementing the architecture and push the app to the playstore soon. One of my plans is, I plan to learn how to use semantic version, and implementing it throughout the continous developement process. If you interested with the idea of learning together along the process, please keep watch this repo. The development progress would be push.
